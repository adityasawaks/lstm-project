Sañjaya, a minister temporarily granted clairvoyance, has been tasked with giving Dhṛtarāṣṭra, the blind Kaurava king, a blow-by-blow narration. On the Kaurava side, the grand patriarch Bhīṣma blows his tremendous conch, roaring like a lion, setting off horns and trumpets, cymbals and drums, heralding what is to come. On the Pāṇḍava side, Kṛṣṇa blows his conch Pāñcajanya, and the five brothers theirs, Arjuna, his Devadatta, Yudhiṣṭhira, his Anantavijaya, Bhīma, his mighty Pauṇḍra, and Nakula and Sahadeva, their Sughoṣa and Maṇipuṣpaka.

        "A list. And the epic, which has all of life and then some, is strewn with lists. The form accomplishes a lot with a little. It builds scenes layer by layer. It accretes, elevates, and expands feeling—thrilling awe and power here; fear, futility, and despondency there; joy and victory elsewhere. It permits story after story to get in through osmosis, establishing epic architecture in the mind, until you have always known it, until you have never not known it. “No Indian ever hears the Mahabharata for the first time,” said A.K. Ramanujan, a noted poet and scholar.\n",

But we tend to forget how mythic and subversive (as we have just seen), joyful and maddening, enchanting and sobering, and utterly chilling lists can be—and what they can do. To love a list is to partake in letter and word, form and change. To make lists is to join a long line of list makers, to indulge in a timeless art, to break down the artificial wall that separates thinking and doing, thinkers and doers.\n",

        "We Like Lists Because We Don’t Want to Die (Umberto Eco, Interview with Spiegel, November 2009)\n",
        "List making to comprehend infinity and ensure immortality! This interview succeeds in putting a spotlight on the list form by probing the mind and work of one of its most radical and vocal lovers. For Eco—a philosopher, semiotician, and novelist, whose own work teems with lists—the list is the creator, curator, and arbiter of culture, and by extension, civilization. He points out how Homer, in attempting to convey the size of the Greek army in The Iliad, “cannot find the right metaphor, and so he begs the muses to help him. Then he hits upon the idea of naming many, many generals and their ships.” As we saw earlier, the infinitely ambitious Mahābhārata, seven times longer than The Iliad and The Odyssey combined, uses the same technique to express the inexpressible.\n",
        "\n",
        "The list is the origin of culture. It’s part of the history of art and literature. What does culture want? To make infinity comprehensible. It also wants to create order—not always, but often. And how, as a human being, does one face infinity? How does one attempt to grasp the incomprehensible? Through lists, through catalogs, through collections in museums and through encyclopedias and dictionaries. There is an allure to enumerating how many women Don Giovanni slept with: It was 2,063, at least according to Mozart’s librettist, Lorenzo da Ponte. We also have completely practical lists—the shopping list, the will, the menu—that are also cultural achievements in their own right.\n",

        "What if… Listicles Are Actually an Ancient Form of Writing and Narrative? (James Vincent, Lit Hub, November 2022)\n",
        "This informative essay presents the list as “one of humanity’s oldest writing systems.” There are older oral (and enumerative) traditions across the world, but the written word seems to have originated with Mesopotamia, Mesoamerica, China, and Egypt—particularly the Mesopotamian civilization of Sumer, through which the essay takes a gentle stroll. The earliest uses of the list were lexical and administrative. Nonetheless, all that naming, counting, and cataloging fed our big brains. Eco concurs, in a manner reminiscent of facet analysis, “The list is the mark of a highly advanced, cultivated society because a list allows us to question the essential definitions. The essential definition is primitive compared with the list.” Let’s hope the palate-sticking ickiness of the word “listicle” is no measure of our alleged advancement.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists may not seem like cognitive dynamite, but their proliferation appears to have helped develop new modes of thought in early societies, encouraging us to think analytically about the world. “The list relies on discontinuity rather than continuity,” writes anthropologist Jack Goody. “[I]t encourages the ordering of the items, by number, by initial sound, by category, etc. And the existence of boundaries, external and internal, brings greater visibility to categories, at the same time as making them more abstract.\n",
        "\n",
        "As Goody argues, the process of constructing a thematic list “leads to increments of knowledge, to the organization of experience.” It is a precursor to organized philosophical systems, and, eventually, to science.\n",

        "Literary Lists are Records of Female Desire (Cynthia Gralla, Electric Literature, October 2019)\n",
        "Eco’s The Infinity of Lists is always drawn upon in the matter of lists because it is vast and voluble on the subject. But as Gralla rightly notes, where are the women? And I must add, where is the other half of the world? It only covers the West. I suppose half of infinity is still infinity. Literature loves lists, and there is a lot of ground to cover. This delicate essay notes, “one of the archaic definitions of list is ‘to like, wish, choose,’ a cognate to the German gelüsten, ‘to desire or lust.’” “Lists are lusts itemized,” the author says, traversing a terrain dotted with Japanese court literature, French erotica, and contemporary poetry, fiction, and memoir, exploring and questioning their female authors and protagonists and their various desires and preoccupations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Truth be told, literary lists catalog desire in all forms. One of the most famous examples is Casanova’s The Story of My Life, a compendium of conquests strained through the male gaze. In such a text, lists can amount to a fragmentation of the (usually female) body of the beloved— an additional, twisted conquest to complement the one made off the page.\n",
        "\n",
        "Are women’s literary lists intrinsically different from men’s? It’s tempting to see them as a part of a larger effort by female authors over the centuries to claim agency through fragments like diary entries or letters. Unlike a collection, which subsumes parts in a whole, a list yearns with each entry, honoring its disparate items. In the case of many female lit listers, their catalogs desire to transform both author and readers through that longing.\n",

        "Georges Perec: A User’s Manual (Matthew Gidley, Frieze, June 2000)\n",
        "In 1960 France, Raymond Queneau and François Le Lionnais formed the Ouvroir de Littérature Potentielle (Workshop of Potential Literature), better known as the Oulipo, with the stated aim of using rules and constraints, often mathematical, in literature. A list, as a form, is a fruitful constraint. Italo Calvino, a member of the Oulipo, put it to beautiful use in Invisible Cities, “I should now list the wares that can profitably be bought here [in Anastasia]: agate, onyx, chrysoprase, and other varieties of chalcedony …. ” and in If On a Winter’s Night a Traveller. But it was Georges Perec who took the “love of taxonomy to its blazing reductio” with Life: A User’s Manual. Mapping a 10 x 10 chessboard to each cell of which was attached a series of lists, or “schedule of obligations,” onto the elevation of a Parisian townhouse, he made a “Knight’s Tour” of movements, which then became the novel. This sharp essay dissects his cataloging mind.\n",
        "\n",
        "… Perec remained true to his favourite themes of classifying and schematising places and objects (such as alternative methods for the ‘art and manner of arranging one’s books’) – and he compiled lists. These ranged from a catalogue of all the different beds in which he had slept, to a detailed description of the evolution of the Rue Vilin over a 12 year period, and his notorious Attempt at an Inventory of the Liquid and Solid Foodstuffs Ingurgitated by Me in the Course of the Year Nineteen Hundred and Seventy-Four (1976) – ‘one thrush paté… fourteen cucumber salads… seven pigs’ trotters… one chicken kebab… two guava sorbets… one Saint-Emilion ’61… four Guinness’. Another member of the Oulipo, Claude Berge, had proposed that a novel could be built around a theoretical mathematical structure known as a ten by ten Graeco-Latin bi-square, and Perec realised that by using this structure as a reference to a series of lists, such a novel would almost write itself.\n",

        "In this essay, which grew into the beautiful book The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right, Gawande, surgeon and MacArthur Fellow, offers a thoughtful meditation on a simple idea for a complex world—the checklist. Drawing examples from fields of great complexity, such as flying advanced aircraft and providing critical care for trauma patients, where the total volume of knowledge far surpasses any individual’s capacity for retention and flawless retrieval, the author observes what a simple, unassuming tool might be able to accomplish. The willingness to use checklists, he suggests, is a welcome admission of human fallibility and a step toward addressing it.\n",
        "\n",
        "We have the means to make some of the most complex and dangerous work we do—in surgery, emergency care, and I.C.U. medicine—more effective than we ever thought possible. But the prospect pushes against the traditional culture of medicine, with its central belief that in situations of high risk and complexity what you want is a kind of expert audacity—the right stuff, again. Checklists and standard operating procedures feel like exactly the opposite, and that’s what rankles many people.\n",
        "\n",
        "It’s ludicrous, though, to suppose that checklists are going to do away with the need for courage, wits, and improvisation. The body is too intricate and individual for that: good medicine will not be able to dispense with expert audacity. Yet it should also be ready to accept the virtues of regimentation.\n",

        "He bought me a Long Island iced tea – a cocktail that contains five clear spirits but tastes like Coca-Cola. “You like it?” he asked.

Something clicked when I saw the photo of a 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre with a markedly older Prince Andrew. She looked so young. I pulled up a photo of me at that same age. Big smile, round cheeks. A teenager, for sure, but also: a child. I was incensed.\n",

        "Back in 2001, in Belgium, if you were an adult having sex with a 15-year-old, you were in a legal gray zone. Sex with anyone younger than 14 was considered statutory rape. Sex with anyone 16 or above, and you were good. But sex with anyone 14 or 15 was considered a euphemistic attentat à la pudeur, which translates literally as an “attack on modesty”.\n",

        "\n",
        "Fred and I remained together on and off for four years. Every now and then, he would break things off, or cheat. When he did, I stayed focused, waiting to be picked back up. I tried to be good. My eating disorder took hold.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "By the time my mother found out – the porn initiation, the so-called gray-zone sex – so much of it and more had already happened. She had a conversation with him one-on-one, imposed limits that were agreed to in word only. She turned to the family doctor for guidance. He told her that having a steady older boyfriend was likely better for me than having non-committal sex with boys my age who didn’t care.\n",
        "\n",
        "Any outrage tended to turn the lens of scrutiny not on him, but on me\n",
        "That this was the paradox presented to her by a doctor baffles me. For starters, it treated my sexuality as fully formed, which it wasn’t, and suggested the main areas of concern were commitment and respectability, which they shouldn’t have been. With hindsight, it is particularly striking to note how absent from any of these conversations the language of consent was.\n",
        "\n",
        "Female sexuality was about access. It was “before her first time” or “after her first time”, “pure” versus “touched” – along with the presumption, and fear, of floodgates opening. But what of the human beings, the emotional landscapes, the physical bodies still shaping themselves, and being shaped?\n",
        "\n",
        "The adults in my life who knew mostly opted for tolerance and support. It seemed preferable to moralistic patriarchal condemnation that would ultimately judge me as tarnished.\n",
        "\n",
        "Any outrage tended to turn the lens of scrutiny not on him, but on me. Fred’s parents treated me like a manipulative, bad influence. As far as I know, they placed no limits on him, even as he was initially still living with them in their apartment, but they made sure to express disapproval of me. Nor would they have been the first to take this stance. After all, the expression “jailbait” places the power with the underage girl, and victimhood on the adult man who must resist the hook, her pull. It is the men who must be protected from girls.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fred stood up for me against the whispers. I was grateful to him. In my adolescent mind, it was us against the world. That was all that mattered.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the time I was 16 and he was 24, our relationship had become normalized. We had overcome indignation and acceded banality. I had reached my majorité sexuelle – my “sexual adulthood”.\n",

        "We were the plot of a hundred movies, a thousand books.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fred became a part of my adolescent routine, and a respectable-presenting one at that. He stayed up to date on the news and routinely impressed people with facts of the day. After finishing his thesis and graduating college, he got his first job in finance. He always showed up to the front door impeccably dressed – more often than not in a piece of clothing featuring the print of a polo player. He helped improve my basketball shot and eventually took over coaching my team. His close friends accepted me – some of them I truly adored.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "His carefully maintained facade did little to quell regular, private sadistic outbursts. He had a love for fast, drunk driving that ramped up the more frightened I became. I can still hear him laughing as he swerved the corner, descending the hill towards the square I lived off, me begging him to slow down. “Is this better?” he would inquire, foot pressing on the accelerator pedal.\n",

        "Fred, in turn, introduced me to the term “frigid” – a diagnosis that seemed, if anything, to pique his interest.\n",
        "\n",
        "Later, when I finally formulated the word “no” and he kept going anyway, I remember sobbing in the bathroom by his sister’s room. From the pain, sure, but also – from relief. The charade had finally lifted. It was spoken.\n",
        "\n",
        "I never did have a physiological problem, as it turns out – something I discovered, like many girls who become women, years too late.\n",

        "But you knew that already.\n",
        "\n",
        "By my last year of high school, 17 and 60lb lighter than the healthy weight I am today, my patterns of numbing were fully locked in. I had learned to dissociate in dozens of different, sometimes creative ways. Some days, I would walk home from school, my mother still at work, binge on a pack of cookies from the gas station, and defy house rules by turning the temperature up. Drowsy from the overeating, from the heat, I would invariably pass out. Self-harm was my refuge back into myself, I believed. I didn’t have the tools to understand that it was only taking me away further.\n",
        "\n",
        "So many men have written versions of my story as tales of female sexual awakening\n",
        "That year, Fred and I “weren’t together”. I was the side chick to a woman he had met at work, who was his age. He took to showing up, unannounced, to places he knew I would be. “Your boyfriend is here,” the assistant basketball coach for the new team I was a part of would flatly tell me, pointing to the balcony above our practice court. I would look up, adrenaline pumping, and lock eyes with him. “He’s not my boyfriend,” I would retort. A small act of defiance, if only for myself. By the time I looked up again, he would be gone.\n",
        "\n",
        "He lurked at night, too; gave me rides home, after detours via parking lots. It wasn’t exciting any more, but I felt desperate. I was desperate for my fix – a fix that would, for a brief time at least, I believed, make me feel like I held value, like I was alive, like I was seen. My loyalty was ghost-like. I saw no alternative.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ibroke up with Fred at 18. Months after I formulated the word “no”, full repulsion finally set in. I couldn’t take him coming close to me. This time, I had my body to thank. There was no going back. Four years in, I was an adult, and I freed myself. But how much had already been shaped? How much was left to be mine?\n",
        "\n",
        "So many men have written versions of my story as tales of female sexual awakening. But Fred’s normalizing of what can be summarized as a rape dynamic had a lasting impact on my ability to affirmatively be present with the partners that came after him – those I did consent to. It was, at best, a sexual darkening from which my own sexuality emerged decades later, in spite of – not because of – it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conservatives will have you believe the sexual revolution was a failure – that more sexual agency hasn’t made women happier, or more free. But men barraging their way past basic consent; men having sex with teenagers – that was never part of any liberation agenda.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our sexual revolution has always been a fight for basic human rights, self-determination and full bodily autonomy for all. It is a fight for more consent, more respect – a fight for freedom and for safety. There is no logical reason we should have to pick between one or the other.\n",
        "\n",
        "Girls and women, like all human beings, should be afforded the space to form their own sexuality on their own terms in their own time. That involves some protection, like enforced consent laws that recognize developmental differences. It also involves insisting on shifting mores to accurately confront scripts that are only in place to manipulate and exploit.\n",
        "\n",
        "After I left him, I mostly didn’t think about Fred. We didn’t speak. He wrote for the first few years. Drunkenly left messages, sent emails. I changed numbers, addresses, countries. Over the years, the messages dwindled. I liked it that way.\n",
        "\n",
        "Towards the end of 2022, when I made my Instagram public in preparation for my book coming out, he was one of the first to follow me. He was often among the first to watch my Stories.\n",
        "\n",
        "I wondered whether I should block him, but decided against it. No, I thought, let him watch me thrive in spite of it all. Let him download my freaking book on Audible and listen to me tell him about feminism.\n",
        "\n",
        "Anything more he would get out of me would be on my terms.\n",
        "\n",
        "The only time I had ever referred to him in my writing, I had called him Eric. He was a brief detail in a story about a formative conversation I had with my mother in my book’s opening chapter. I portrayed him briefly and haplessly, and didn’t use his real name – not to protect him, but to deny him a place in the narrative of his favorite hunt. Even in an unflattering light, my gut told me, he would have felt a thrill from being named. An arousal.\n",

        "\n",
        "Towards the film’s end, Neruda comes face to face with his human tormenter as the latter is dying in the Andes Mountains.

        "From the beginning, Jones realized blending in with students would be much more complicated than it sounded during the newsroom pitch. First was the age difference. While Jones looked young for 26, the decade or so between the reporter and some of her “peers” amounted to a huge generational gap.\n",
        "\n",
        "Jones was given a $100 wardrobe budget, but emerged from the Emporium on Market Street with well-fitting clothes and popped collars that looked alien among the baggy, formless styles at Washington High. Meanwhile, her complicated fiction was hard to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Once, I accidentally rushed out of the house wearing my wedding ring,” Jones wrote in 1992. “When I noticed it in French class, I panicked.”\n",
        "\n",
        "As the lies multiplied, her bare-bones backstory as “a senior transfer whose family moved from Washington, D.C.” became insufficient. When a drama teacher noticed acting skill — unaware Jones was secretly in the role of her life — teacher and classmates asked her to try out for a major part in the school’s fall play. The timing would have worked, but Jones decided she couldn’t take a role meant for a student.\n",
        "\n",
        "The reporter invented an after-work job to stave off the audition request, then conjured a college-aged boyfriend in case she was seen with her husband in public.\n",
        "\n",
        "“We were living in a sitcom,” Jones wrote in 1992. “Finally he stopped answering the phone altogether.”\n",
        "\n",
        "While Jones struggled to keep her story straight, the reporting was going startlingly well.\n",
        "\n",
        "Walking through Washington High incognito, she witnessed impossible situations and intense frustration from teachers and students that no hand-held school tour could have possibly revealed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Jones immediately made friends with two fellow seniors named Erica and Heather, who’d been assigned by Vidal to show her around. She was also accepted into the Peer Resource Center, an innovative school program built like a clubhouse, where students talked about difficult issues and were encouraged by school counselors to mediate their own disputes. It was a petri dish of thoughtful discussion and raw emotion.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once Jones entered the center, a cast of “Undercover Student” characters developed, including gentle and thoughtful classmate Mario Trigueros and enthusiastic counselor Vicki Abadesco, who was just two years older than her faux student.\n",

        "Meanwhile, Jones saw firsthand how teachers were heroically managing the fallout from Proposition 13. She wrote about English literature teacher Bob Davis, who would spend years scouring garage sales and used bookstores to buy enough copies of “Death of a Salesman” — then go back again for more when his class sizes increased by 25%.\n",

        "Jones’ classmates also came off as complicated figures, brilliant and with seemingly endless potential, but so used to diminishing resources that many didn’t see themselves as victims. It’s the resigned lack of ambition, not the dirty bathrooms or rodents, that resonates most in “Undercover Student.”\n",
        "\n",
        "When Jones attended her first school party, expecting an “Animal House” scene, she instead found soft drinks and apathy. Away from campus and with their guard down, Jones learned that her friend group, who she regarded as some of the smarter kids in the school, considered the jump to a four-year college unattainable.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It’s the middle-class curse,” a student named Uri explained. “Our parents don’t have enough money to pay for college, but they have too much to qualify for aid. So where does that leave us? The answer for a lot of us is just go to junior college instead of worrying about it.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“What a confusing time,” Jones wrote in 1992. “I am seized sometimes with the anxiety that must face them, going unskilled into a world already choked with laid-off workers.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Decades have passed, and Jones is still processing her feelings about “Undercover Student” — from how it felt to carry a backpack and walk the halls to the impact the project had on the people around her. Days after being contacted out of nowhere by the Chronicle, she’s on a video call; early morning in San Francisco and late afternoon in Wales.\n",
        "\n",
        "She says that in 1992, and even now, “High school is still in there.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“It’s an emotional Tupperware,” Jones said during the hourlong interview. “You think that you’ve moved on, but you haven’t. You’ve just put a lid on the emotional Tupperware. But if you go back and open it up, it’s still there. All the things I suffered in high school, I suffered again when I went back.”\n",
        "\n",
        "During her series, Jones wrote about feeling left out when new friends headed to lunch without her, and about developing anxiety over her grades. Initially trying not to do too well, she had a pang of disappointment after receiving a C.\n",

        "“Some things about high school never change — 10 years later, I can still subside into the stomach-churning hurt of being excluded or talked about,” Jones wrote in 1992. “And talk about me they do — I hear through the grapevine that they think I’m a ‘narc.’ ”\n",
        "\n",
        "The “narc” accusations — students accusing Jones of being a cop — are sometimes played for comedy in the series, but presented a very real problem for the reporter, especially after students from the Peer Resource Center started defending her. Not only was Jones being untruthful to classmates and teachers, but she was forming real friendships, and the moment she had to confess to the betrayal was a ticking clock.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It was stressful. And exhausting,” Jones wrote. “I never knew when someone would turn to me and ask a question that I’d have to answer with an unflinching lie.”\n",
        "\n",
        "In her stories, you can sense Jones getting too close, feeling more in touch with the kids she was infiltrating than the adults who were paying her to be there. By mid-October, Jones was telling her editors she couldn’t stand another day.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I survived my month as a high school senior,” Jones wrote. “Now only one task remains — to go back and tell them the truth.”\n",

        "\n",
        "Some kids acted vindicated, but the friends and teachers who knew Jones best were dumbfounded.\n",
        "\n",
        "“We had a meeting with her teachers because we wanted them to be informed in advance,” said Plack, the guidance counselor who’d been in on the ruse from the beginning. “One of them just wouldn’t believe it. She said, ‘No, no, it can’t be. That’s my student.’ ”\n",

        "Liz Hafalia/The Chronicle\n",
        "In a recent interview, Mario Trigueros, who became one of Jones’ closer friends during the deception, remembered being surprised by the plot twist. There was something odd about Jones, he said, but she had gravitated toward a friend group who themselves were considered eccentrics and didn’t fit neatly into the school’s cliques.\n",
        "\n",
        "At first, there were hugs after her confession, and Jones came back to see the school play and hand out roses to performers from her drama class.\n",
        "\n",
        "But as time went on, the split between those who appreciated the series and those who felt hurt by it grew wider. For several days, readers sent the paper letters hailing the reports, while many of the students involved grew more resentful and felt unheard.\n",
        "\n",
        "Vicki Abadesco, the Peer Resource Center counselor, said in a recent interview that at the time, administrators and some teachers seemed pleased about Jones’ undercover reporting, hoping it would sound the alarm about their crippling budget crisis. But many students were livid.\n",
        "\n",
        "“They told me, ‘Vicki, you’ve got to calm (the students) down,’ ” Abadesco remembered. “And I thought, ‘I’m not going to calm them down. … I’m not going to try to silence them. If they’re angry and they want to march, then I’m going to help them figure out how to do that.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Abadesco, who founded the social-emotional learning organization Soul Shoppe in 2001 and continues to work with children, accompanied several students to a meeting at the Chronicle newsroom to discuss the series. It was unsatisfying, she recalled. Jones seemed quiet and formal, like just another adult, but the counselor was proud of her students for speaking up.\n",

        "Trigueros said he was not among the most distressed of Jones’ classmates and listened to both sides of the debate.
